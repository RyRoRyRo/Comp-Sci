1: Carrie Cai, a computer science graduate from MIT specializing in computer interfaces for online learning and language education. She specializes in teaching others the fundemental basics of programming. When carrie isnt programing she wors a lot in the arts. She is a "fusion" dancer and musician regularly playing the piano. I personally enjoy both music and programming so carrie stood out to me because of her career and love of both.

2: Sarah Northway is a indie game designer creating games with her husband, predominantly using flash software for mobile games. Sarah supports her projects through Kickstarter crowdsource funding and in-game ads. Sarah is a full time game developer who left her job at 26 to persue her passion of game desieng full time. Sarah lives a very free life earning enough money to live comofortably and travel freely. The idea of game design being a stable career that allows her to travel and enjoy her life after taking a big risk of leaving her job inspires me and reminds me to follow my passions.
